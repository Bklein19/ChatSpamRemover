# ChatSpamRemover

This is just a work in progress that may eventually be implemented with some language modeling processes to dynamically detect spam in a livestream chat to filter it out (or into some other section).

## Goals:

<ul>
  Draw data from some livestreaming platform (Twitch, Youtube, Facebook, Stream.club, etc)  
  
  Implement language modeling (either via home made modeling or some pre-trained model like GPT or AGI)  
  
  Build this out into some visualization  
</ul>
